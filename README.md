# LinkedIn Post Generator Using ChatGroq and Excel

This project automates the generation of LinkedIn posts based on ideas provided in an Excel file. Using a simple script, it fetches an idea from an Excel sheet, uses the `ChatGroq` model to generate a professional LinkedIn post, and then posts it on LinkedIn using the LinkedIn API. Once a post is successfully created, the script updates the Excel file to mark the idea as "posted."

## Project Workflow

1. **Input Idea in Excel:**
   - You provide short LinkedIn post ideas in an Excel file (`topic.xlsx`). Each row contains an idea in the "topic" column, and the "status" column is used to track if the idea has already been posted.
2. **Generate LinkedIn Post:**
   - The script reads the first idea from the Excel file that has not yet been posted (`NaN` status), sends the idea to the `ChatGroq` language model for enrichment, and generates a well-written LinkedIn post.
3. **Post to LinkedIn:**
   - Once the LinkedIn post is generated, the script automatically publishes the post on your LinkedIn profile using LinkedIn's API.
4. **Update Excel File:**
   - After a post is successfully published, the script updates the status of the corresponding row in the Excel file to "posted" to avoid duplicate posts in the future.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- An API key for accessing the [Groq API](https://groq.com/) for using the `ChatGroq` model.
- A LinkedIn account with access to LinkedIn's API and an API key (`linkedin_API_KEY`).
- The following Python libraries:
  - `langchain_groq`
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`
  - `python-dotenv`

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install langchain_groq pandas requests python-dotenv
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

To access the Groq API and LinkedIn API, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
linkedin_API_KEY=your_linkedin_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` and `your_linkedin_api_key_here` with the actual API keys.

### 4. Excel File Setup

Create an Excel file (`topic.xlsx`) in the same directory with the following columns:

- **topic**: Contains the idea for the LinkedIn post.
- **status**: Tracks the status of the post (e.g., `NaN` for ideas that haven't been posted yet).

Example:

| topic                                 | status |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| "How to stay productive at work?"     | NaN    |
| "The importance of a morning routine" | NaN    |

### 5. Run the Script

Run the Python script to generate and post a LinkedIn update:

```bash
python llm_helper.py
```

This will read the first idea with a `NaN` status, generate a LinkedIn post using the `ChatGroq` model, and publish it to LinkedIn. After posting, the script will update the Excel file to reflect the status as "posted."

## Script Overview

The script is divided into the following key parts:

1. **Loading Environment Variables:**

   - The `.env` file is loaded using the `python-dotenv` library to securely access the API keys for both Groq and LinkedIn.

2. **Reading Excel File:**

   - The `pandas` library is used to read the Excel file (`topic.xlsx`), filter out rows that have already been posted, and fetch the first idea to be processed.

3. **Generate LinkedIn Post:**

   - The `ChatGroq` model (from the `langchain_groq` library) is invoked with the idea extracted from the Excel file. The model enriches the idea into a complete and well-written LinkedIn post.

4. **Post to LinkedIn:**

   - The LinkedIn API is used to create the post with the generated content. The post is made public and appears on your LinkedIn feed.

5. **Update Excel File:**
   - After successfully posting, the script updates the status of the respective idea in the Excel file to "posted."

### Example of Generated LinkedIn Post:

```bash
How to stay productive at work?

Staying productive at work is all about maintaining focus and using your time efficiently. Here are a few tips:
1. Break your work into smaller tasks.
2. Prioritize important tasks.
3. Take short breaks to refresh your mind.

By following these strategies, youâ€™ll be able to stay on track and accomplish your goals more effectively!
```

### Example of Excel After Posting:

| topic                                 | status |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| "How to stay productive at work?"     | posted |
| "The importance of a morning routine" | NaN    |

## Customization

- **Change Prompt Text:** You can modify the prompt or idea provided in the Excel file. Simply add or update the entries in the "topic" column.
- **LinkedIn Post Settings:** You can adjust the visibility, media types, or other LinkedIn post properties by modifying the API request parameters in the script.
